**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Overview

Image Inspector ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data when you use it.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Access

When you click the extension icon and request image analysis, the extension accesses:
- **Image elements** on the current active webpage
- **Image properties** including URLs, dimensions, formats, and file sizes
- **Page URL** of the current tab

### How We Use This Data

- **Local Processing Only**: All image analysis happens entirely within your browser
- **Display Purposes**: Image information is displayed in the extension's popup interface
- **No Storage**: We do not store, save, or cache any data
- **No Transmission**: We do not send any data to external servers or third parties
- **No Collection**: We do not collect, track, or log any information

### When We Access Data

The extension only accesses data when:
- You explicitly click the extension icon in your browser toolbar
- You click the "Show Image Details" button in the popup

The extension does NOT:
- Run automatically in the background
- Access tabs without your explicit action
- Monitor your browsing activity
- Access data from tabs you're not currently viewing

## Data Storage

**We do not store any data.** All processing is done in real-time and discarded immediately after use. No information is:
- Saved to your device
- Stored in cloud services
- Cached for future use
- Transmitted to any server

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data.** The extension:
- Does not send data to external servers
- Does not share data with third parties
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not integrate with any external APIs for data processing

## Permissions Used

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows reading the current tab's content only when you click the extension icon
- **`scripting`**: Allows injecting a content script to analyze images on the current page

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and are not used for any other purpose.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, or external resources. All functionality is self-contained within the extension package.

## Children's Privacy

The extension does not knowingly collect or process data from children. Since we don't collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect, store, or transmit any data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. All processing happens locally in your browser and is immediately discarded.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy or how the extension handles data, please contact us through the extension's GitHub repository or Chrome Web Store listing.

## Summary

**In short:** Image Inspector works entirely locally in your browser. It only accesses the current webpage's images when you explicitly request it, displays the information to you, and then discards it. No data is collected, stored, transmitted, or shared with anyone.
